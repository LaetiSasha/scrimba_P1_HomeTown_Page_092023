				<h2>One fun fact about my hometown</h2>
				<p>
					The word "limoger" is believed to have originated from the
					name of a town called Limoges. <br />In the 19th century,
					during the July Monarchy in France, the town of Limoges was
					associated with political intrigue and reshuffling of
					military officers. Here's the fun fact: The term "limoger"
					became associated with the practice of removing or
					reassigning military officers from their posts. It was often
					used to describe the act of sending an officer to Limoges as
					a form of disciplinary action or to remove them from their
					current position. <br />Over time, this term evolved to
					encompass the broader meaning of dismissing or removing
					someone from any position, not just military. So, when you
					use the term "limoger" in French to mean "to dismiss" or "to
					remove from a position," you're actually using a word with
					historical ties to a specific town and a particular
					historical context.
